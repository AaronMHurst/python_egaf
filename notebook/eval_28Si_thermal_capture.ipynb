    "\n",
    "To help validate the thermal-capture decay scheme data it is important to include all measured statistically-significant contributions to $\\sigma_{0}$ and, ideally, raise $E_{c}$ as high as possible to include accurate and complete decay-scheme information.  The RIPL file provides a recommended $E_{c}$ which may serve as a useful starting point for a statistical-model calculation.  We can increase this value provided that we have good experimental nuclear structure data, i.e., complete information regarding $\\gamma$-ray energies, branching ratios, and internal conversion coefficients (therefore, multipolarities and mixing ratios) as well as level energies and corresponding $J^{\\pi}$ information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with an assumed $E_{c}$ we can compare the experimental $\\gamma$-ray data to the statistical-model predictions.  If experimental and modeled data compare well, this suggests that the decay-scheme is well balanced and characterized up to $E_{c}$ and lends support to the decay-scheme nuclear-structure assignments.  We can then iteratively increase $E_{c}$, usuallly one level at a time, until there is a breakdown in agreement between experiment and model.  At this point, we can attempt to \"fix\" the decay scheme, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check for any possible missing $\\gamma$ rays or adjust intensities if it makes sense to do so.\n",
    "* If any of the $\\gamma$ rays have unknown or poorly known mixing ratios ($\\delta_{\\gamma}$), try adjusting this quantity to arrive at new internal conversion coefficients to improve agreement between model and experiment.\n",
    "* Adjustments to $J^{\\pi}$ within reason; non-physical values should not be given, e.g., changing the assignment of a band member that would otherwise throw it out of step with other band members.  For firmly-assigned $J^{\\pi}$ values, a very strong argument would be needed to change its value.  However, there is usually room for maneuver with tentative or unknown assignments.  Any changes here will also require checking the multipolarities of all transitions feeding and deexciting the corresponding level.  Similarly, any known multipolarities may also be used to help pin down possible $J^{\\pi}$ assignments of the level.\n",
    "\n",
    "If further changes to the decay scheme cannot be justified and agreement between model and experiment is still poor then the value of $E_{c}$ has been exceeded and a lower value must be adopted.  The point at which agreement breaks down may imply that significant decay-scheme information is missing and the statistical model is unable to reproduce the known data.  The point at which this happens varies from nucleus to nucleus."
